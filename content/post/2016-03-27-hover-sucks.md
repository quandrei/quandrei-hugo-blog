This is minor rant really, but I have been mildly annoyed with my domain registrar, [Hover](https://www.hover.com/), recently. Several months ago, I inquired whether I would be able to pay in [CAD](http://www.xe.com/currency/cad-canadian-dollar), instead of being charged in [USD](http://www.xe.com/currency/usd-us-dollar) (and then having my credit card company add a surcharge due to foreign currency conversion). I thought this would be a trivial and easy request to grant since they are a Canadian company, and I am a Canadian citizen, and it would stand to reason we could do business using our nation's legitimate currency. Not only was the answer a no, but the they gave me some bogus reasoning why they couldn't. Furthermore, they implied that I should take my business elsewhere if I was not happy with that policy. So I have, and moved my domains elsewhere.

The sad thing is, they are not the only Canadian company I have dealt with that operate this way. Companies that enjoy many benefits of our great nation, through tax shelters and government grants/subsidies, and yet the locals who support them are treated shabbily. For shame!
