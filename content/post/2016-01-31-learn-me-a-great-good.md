### PHP, we all fall down

So PHP has been getting me down lately, and I have been looking for the next new thing to get my mojo rising. Despite some improvements that came out of [PHP7](http://php.net/archive/2016.php#id2016-05-26-1) and dependency tools like [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), there are a great many things that make day-to-day development, well, annoying. Among them, they include:

* an identity crisis, where it adopts the verbosity of Java in many of its bloated frameworks, but also retains its procedural style from its C-like hay day
* a lack of types, causing unpredictability and a debugging nightmare
* natural assumptions regarding built in functions seem to take a holiday
* the fact that its used considerably on the web, and everybody's cousin is learning just enough to be dangerous, I often encounter terrible code I have the pleasure of supporting/maintaining
* Wordpress and Drupal

If "Why PHP sucks" is a topic that interests you, some fair points can be found [here](http://webonastick.com/php.html) and [here](https://whydoesitsuck.com/why-does-php-suck/).

### So what next?

I've tried a few things over the past few months that may have some promise:

**[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) / [Rails](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)** - easy to get a web app up and running. Although, I need to learn more about how the underpinnings work, since the automagically generating everything doesn't sit well with me.

**[Python](https://www.python.org/) / [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)** - simple/clean syntax, and the flexibility of being a general purpose language, has made learning python a great asset to my toolset.

**[Go](https://golang.org/)** - the most interesting option so far, as it has numerous features that appeal to me:

* statically typed, compiled language
* concise/clean
* concurrency baked-in
* comprehensive standard library (without the need for additional tools to get things done)

Over the next few months, I will be working with Go quite a bit (it being one of the core development languages at my new digs) and am really excited to get more proficient with it. Hopefully, a quote I heard a number of years ago, doesn't ring true:

> Never fall in love with a language. It will always break your heart.
