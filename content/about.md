This site is a little slice of cyberspace that is mine. It is place for me to talk about tech/projects I am working on, and everyday thoughts on life that come up in between coffees.

I made it, all on my own. It may not be glamorous, or even work in some places, but it's still good. [Yeah, still good](https://youtu.be/Gx0LA2tPXvU).
