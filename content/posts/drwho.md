## Ipsum generators for the win...

So while working on the site, I needed some filler text to test. So why not use trusty old lorem ipsum. To my surpise, I discovered many other variations [here](https://loremipsum.io/ultimate-list-of-lorem-ipsum-generators/). And better than that, I found a [Doctor Who Ipsum generator](http://doctoripsum.com/). 

I was, however, disappointed to see that the [Space Ipsum](https://open.nasa.gov/blog/space-ipsum/) generator site [domain](http://spaceipsum.com/) seems to have been usurped, and now being used to sell steroids.  

Anyway, here is a sample...

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable!

Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. What? What?! WHAT?! There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.

Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Allons-y! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Goodbye...my Sarah Jane!

You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these. I'm Scottish. I can complain about things now. I can really complain about things now. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for 'minimalism', but I think I came up with 'magician'.

I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English. Come on, Team Not Dead. I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. That's a relief. I hate babysitters. Underneath it all I think you're probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren't a soldier. You realise one of us is lying about our basic programming. And I think we both know which one that is. Can I talk about planets now?

Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. So you've got a room for not being awake in. What's the point? You're just missing the room! Come on, Team Not Dead. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for 'minimalism', but I think I came up with 'magician'.
