No doubt, you have noticed the sparseness of the number of posts on this site. I decided it was time for change, and purged all those articles that no longer sparked joy. Likewise, for my twitter account.

I kept a few that I liked, but most of them went into the recylcing bin. Moving forward, hopefully, I will post more quality content as time moves forward. Or backward. Or twirling towards some abstract goal.
