I am not a ninja, or guru, or [rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/code) developer.

I am a multi-disciplinary software developer with a wide range of experience. I have seen a lot of things and enjoy learning new tech, but with that comes a price. Am I the authority on a given language/tool? Probably not, but I would guess I could figure it out. My greatest asset, is that I can adapt to new settings and challenges. Tinkering with new technology is what excites me about my domain, but always making sure I am solving problems and providing quality/value, is what drives me.

Subjects that interest me in my industry are DevOps, security, IaC, and automation.

Interests outside my developer gig, you will probably be able to deduce by poking around some of my posts. Hope you enjoy the trip.
