This is a home for all that is dev outside my regular gig as a software developer, with a few other interests peppered in. Formerly on [squarespace](http://squarespace.com/), I decided to move to github pages, and haven't looked back. If you're interested why, read [this](http://quandrei.github.io/2014/03/20/github-pages-transition/).

#### Setup for this site:

* Deployed using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a wicked static site generator
* Hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Built using tools like [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Oh my ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/), in between coffees
* Using [Red Lounge](http://themes.gohugo.io/redlounge/) as a theme
